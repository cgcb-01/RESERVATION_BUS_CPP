# 🚍 Bus Reservation System Management in C++

> A **feature-rich, command-line-based Bus Reservation System** built in **C++**, utilizing key **Operating System concepts** such as **socket programming**, **multi-threading**, and robust **file handling** for persistent storage. The system supports a dual-interface for **passengers and drivers**, enabling actions like user/driver registration, secure login via Aadhar/License, trip creation and management, dynamic seat layout handling (including window seat pricing), and a full-fledged ticket booking workflow with real-time seat availability checks and validations. Designed with a modular architecture and intuitive terminal-based UI using ANSI formatting, it ensures both functionality and usability for scalable offline simulations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the development or usage of this project, follow the instructions below:

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (such as g++, clang++)
- Terminal or command line
### 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cgcb-01/RESERVATION_BUS_CPP.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd RESERVATION_BUS_CPP

    ```
3. Install the libssl-dev
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libssl-dev
   ```

### ⚙️ Compilation

To compile the project, you can use the following command in the terminal:

- `newserver.cpp`: The server client implementation code.
- `users.txt`: The details of the users stored here after successful registration.
- `drivers.txt`: A file containing all the details regarding successfully registered drivers.
- `buses.txt`: Information regarding buses present. 
- `trips.txt`: The trips present in our project.
- `bookings.txt`: A file contains all the confirmed bookings.
- `seatT00X.txt`: The seat matrix of the trips existing in our project.
- `screenshots/`: The folder containing all the screenshots of the project.
